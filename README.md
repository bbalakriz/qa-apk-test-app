## 🎭 Writing Tests (No Coding Required!)

### Create Feature Files
Write tests in plain English using **Gherkin syntax**:

```gherkin
Feature: User Registration

  @smoke @registration
  Scenario: New user signs up successfully
    Given the app is launched
    When I enter "john.doe@email.com" into field with id "email"
    And I enter "SecurePass123" into field with id "password"
    And I tap on element with id "signupButton"
    Then I should see element with id "welcomeMessage"

  @regression
  Scenario: User login with invalid credentials
    Given the app is launched
    When I enter "invalid@email.com" into field with id "email"
    And I enter "wrongpassword" into field with id "password"
    And I tap on element with id "loginButton"
    Then I should see element containing text "Invalid credentials"
```

### Pre-built Step Library
We provide **ready-to-use steps** for common actions:

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Given the app is launched` | Launch and verify app |
| `When I tap on element with id "buttonId"` | Tap buttons, links |
| `When I enter "text" into field with id "fieldId"` | Fill text fields |
| `Then I should see element with id "elementId"` | Verify element exists |
| `Then I should see element containing text "text"` | Verify text content |
| `When I wait for 3 seconds` | Add delays |
| `When I navigate back` | Go back |

**No coding required!** Just write scenarios using these steps.

## 🛠️ Available Commands

### 🚀 Setup & Deployment
```bash
npm run setup                    # 🎯 Complete environment setup
npm run deploy /path/to/app.apk  # 🚀 Deploy APK (auto-configures everything)
npm run install-apk app.apk      # 📱 Install APK to emulator
npm run test:setup              # ✅ Verify environment is ready
```

### 🧪 Test Execution
```bash
npm test                         # 🔬 Run all tests
npm run test:smoke              # 🔥 Quick smoke tests (@smoke tag)
npm run test:regression         # 🧪 Full regression suite
npm run verify                 # ✅ Environment health check
```

### 🔧 Utilities

## 📊 Advanced Features

### 🏷️ Test Tags & Organization
Organize tests with tags:

```gherkin
@smoke @critical @login
Scenario: Critical login flow
  # This test runs in smoke and critical suites

@regression @payment @slow
Scenario: Complete payment flow
  # This test only runs in regression suite
```

Run specific test sets:
```bash
npx wdio run wdio.conf.js --cucumberOpts.tagExpression='@smoke and not @slow'
npx wdio run wdio.conf.js --cucumberOpts.tagExpression='@critical or @payment'
```

### 📸 Auto-Screenshots
- ✅ Screenshots on test failures
- ✅ Screenshots saved in `screenshots/` with timestamps
- ✅ HTML reports with embedded images

### 🔄 Retry & Recovery
- ✅ Automatic retry on flaky tests
- ✅ Smart element waiting (no more sleep!)
- ✅ Session recovery on crashes

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### E-commerce App Testing
```gherkin
Feature: Product Purchase Flow

  @smoke @purchase
  Scenario: Complete product purchase
    Given the app is launched
    When I tap on element with id "searchButton"
    And I enter "iPhone" into field with id "searchField"
    And I tap on element containing text "Search"
    And I tap on element containing text "iPhone 15"
    And I tap on element with id "addToCartButton"
    And I tap on element with id "cartIcon"
    And I tap on element with id "checkoutButton"
    Then I should see element containing text "Order Confirmation"
```

### Banking App Testing
```gherkin
Feature: Account Balance Check

  @smoke @banking
  Scenario: View account balance
    Given the app is launched
    When I enter "user123" into field with id "username"
    And I enter "password123" into field with id "password"
    And I tap on element with id "loginButton"
    And I wait for 2 seconds
    And I tap on element containing text "Accounts"
    Then I should see element containing text "Current Balance"
```

## 🔧 Configuration Guide

### APK Configuration
The deployment script auto-detects your app package, but you can manually configure:

```javascript
// wdio.conf.js
capabilities: [{
    'appium:app': path.join(process.cwd(), 'app.apk'),
    'appium:appPackage': 'com.yourcompany.yourapp',  // Auto-detected
    'appium:appActivity': '.MainActivity',            // Usually correct
    'appium:platformVersion': '11.0',                // Match your emulator
}]
```

### Test Timeouts
```javascript
// wdio.conf.js
waitforTimeout: 10000,          // 10 seconds for element waiting
connectionRetryTimeout: 120000, // 2 minutes for Appium connection
```

### Parallel Execution
```javascript
// wdio.conf.js
maxInstances: 1,  // Run tests sequentially (recommended for mobile)
// maxInstances: 3,  // Run 3 tests in parallel (if you have multiple devices)
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4723"** | `npm run appium` (start Appium manually) |
| **"Element not found"** | Check element ID with `adb shell uiautomator dump` |
| **"App won't launch"** | Verify emulator is running: `adb devices` |
| **"Metro bundler error"** | Use release APK: `npm run deploy /path/to/release.apk` |
| **"Session creation failed"** | Restart emulator and run `npm run test:setup` |

### 🔍 Debug Commands
```bash
# Check emulator status
adb devices

# Check if app is installed
adb shell pm list packages | grep yourpackage

# View app activity
adb shell dumpsys window windows | grep -E 'mCurrentFocus'

# Capture UI hierarchy
adb shell uiautomator dump /sdcard/ui.xml && adb pull /sdcard/ui.xml

# View device logs
adb logcat | grep yourpackage
```

### 🐛 Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging:
```javascript
// wdio.conf.js
logLevel: 'debug',  // Shows all Appium commands
```

## 🌟 Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- ✅ Use release APKs for stable testing
- ✅ Tag tests appropriately (@smoke, @regression)
- ✅ Use meaningful element IDs in your app
- ✅ Keep scenarios focused and atomic
- ✅ Use the provided helper steps
- ✅ Review screenshots after test failures

### ❌ Don'ts
- ❌ Don't use debug APKs for final testing
- ❌ Don't write overly complex scenarios
- ❌ Don't hardcode delays (use smart waits)
- ❌ Don't ignore test failures
- ❌ Don't test multiple features in one scenario

### 🎯 Writing Good Tests
```gherkin
# ✅ Good - Focused and clear
Scenario: User can add item to cart
  Given the app is launched
  When I search for "iPhone"
  And I select the first result
  And I tap on "Add to Cart"
  Then I should see "Item added to cart"

# ❌ Bad - Too complex
Scenario: Complete user journey
  Given the app is launched
  When I register a new account
  And I login with the account
  And I browse products
  And I add multiple items
  And I proceed to checkout
  And I enter payment details
  And I complete the purchase
  Then everything should work
```
